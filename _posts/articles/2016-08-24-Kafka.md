## Kafka:
Kafka is a distributed, partitioned, replicated commit log service. It provides the functionality of a messaging system, but with a unique design.
First let's review some basic messaging terminology:

* Kafka maintains feeds of messages in categories called topics.
* We'll call processes that publish messages to a Kafka topic producers.
* We'll call processes that subscribe to topics and process the feed of published messages consumers..
* Kafka is run as a cluster comprised of one or more servers each of which is called a broker.
</br>
So, at a high level, producers send messages over the network to the Kafka cluster which in turn serves them up to consumers .

Communication between the clients and the servers is done with a simple, high-performance, language agnostic TCP protocol. We provide a Java client for Kafka, but clients are available in many languages.
